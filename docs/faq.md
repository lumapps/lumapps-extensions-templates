# FAQ

## I want to develop several extension, how can I do that ?
You develop multiple extension in the same repository. You just have to duplicate the sample extension folder for each extension you want to develop.

You can run only one extension in the playground, if you want to test another extension you have to stop and rerun the web server with the wanted extension.

We ask you to make a PR by extension in order to split the validation.
