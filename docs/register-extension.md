# Register your extension
In order to submit and publish your extension you have to register your extension.

To do that you have to launch the extension playground :
```
yarn start
```
And you'll need a Lumapps instance and user to authenticate your API calls.

Then in the top right corner open the Playground Settings, you'll have to first `claim a Provider ID`, in order to `claim an Extension ID`.

**The ProviderId & the ExtensionId must be stored in your extension configuration file.**
