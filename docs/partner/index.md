This guide explains how to register a developer organization, which enables you to manage and build Extensions for the LumApps Marketplace. 


## Registering and managing Partner Organization
Before start developing for the LumApps Marketplace you'll need a declared Partner Organization.
A Partner Organization is basically a set of information to identify the owner of an extension, to give us and customer a way to contact you and later will own group of developers .

### How to Register an Organization
After requesting access to the LumApps Marketplace program, if your request is accepted we will contact you to have information about your organization. 
The following information will be used by LumApps to register your Partner Organization in the LumApps Marketplace and to generate your LumApps Test Platform.
You'll receive all needed information to start working on your extension as soon as your environment is set up on LumApps side.

Needed information : 

| Information        | Description                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Organization name  | The name of your Organization.                                                                                                                             |
| Organization URL   | URL of your organization’s website. The organization URL domain must match the contact email domain, we may reject your registration if it does not match. |
| Organization email | Your support email address used to be contacted by LumApps or customers for support.                                                                        |
| Phone Number       | A phone number to reach your support. This information is not mandatory.                                                                                   |

### What can be the reasons why my request to enter LumApps Market is rejected
We may reject your request to enter the LumApps Marketplace program for several reasons : 
 - The organization name is too similar to an existing organization
 - We could not verify the information you set (Organization website not found, Organization name and website does not match, etc...)
 - The email domain does not match the Organization URL provided
 - The project is not possible with the LumApps Marketplace

## Manage my Partner Organization
Your partner information are available in the LumApps Extension Playground, in the Backoffice interface.
As for now you cannot edit your partner information by yourself, you need to contact the LumApps Marketplace support if you want to edit any of your Partner Organization information.
